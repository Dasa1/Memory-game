## Testing the game

How to test and see everything works fine:

- when you start the game and click on any card, the timer should start
- clicking on two cards equals to the one turn and that is counted as a one move on the move counter
- when u find a matching pair of cards, they stayed flipped over and background color turns from blue to green
-  star rating depends on the number of the moves u take
- after finding all matching pairs popup showns:
  - Congratulation massage
  - number of moves
  - star rating
  - options to play again or to close popup
